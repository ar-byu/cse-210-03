This game uses the Random module to pick a random word from a list of words. Then it allows the player to guess the letters of the word until either the word is completed, or the player reaches a set number of incorrect guesses. After the game is over, it asks if you want to play again.

The required software to run this program is anything that can run Python in a terminal. The creator's reccomendation is Visual Studio Code.
